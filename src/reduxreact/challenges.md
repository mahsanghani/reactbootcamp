# Challenge: set up redux action creators, reducer, and store
We'll be building a counter app to start out.
Read the comments below for the step-by-step challenges
1. Create action creators for having the count "increment" and "decrement"
2. Create a reducer to handle your increment and decrement actions
3. Create a new Redux store
4. Set up the subscribe function so we can more easily see the changes to the Redux state as they happen
5. Export the store as a default export

# Challenge

2. values are the actual parts of the global state your component wants
